Recently, I embarked on a fascinating project to analyze medical data and uncover hidden trends related to cardiac health. Using Python libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, I visualized data from a dataset containing patient information like body measurements, blood tests, and lifestyle choices.

One of the key tasks was to create a new column indicating whether a patient was overweight based on their Body Mass Index (BMI). I then normalized the data to ensure consistent interpretation of values.

To explore the relationships between different factors and cardiac disease, I transformed the data into a long format and created informative visualizations using catplots. These plots allowed me to compare the distribution of categorical features (like cholesterol and glucose levels) for patients with and without cardiac disease.

After cleaning the data to remove outliers and inconsistencies, I constructed a correlation matrix to identify the strongest relationships between various variables. This visual representation helped me understand how factors like body measurements, blood markers, and lifestyle choices might contribute to cardiac health.

I'm currently two (2) projects away from claiming my Data Analysis with Python certification from freeCodeCamp, but so far I must say this project was a valuable learning experience, demonstrating the power of data visualization in uncovering meaningful insights from complex medical data. By combining data analysis techniques with effective visualization, we can gain a deeper understanding of health trends and inform evidence-based medical practices.
